For people who use Arch or any Arch based distro then you will have to
compile vim from source with the following command to get all the
features working.

#+begin_example
git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
cd vim/src
make
sudo make install
#+end_example

If you have already installed fzf from the official fzf github repo then
you can enable keybindings and completion with the following command

#+begin_example
[[ -d $HOME/.fzf ]] && rm -rf $HOME/.fzf
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
~/.fzf/install --all
#+end_example
